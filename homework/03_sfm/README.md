To use this template code, you will need to install [rerun](https://www.rerun.io) for 3D visualization. Do this as follows (again, you might be using `conda` instead of `mamba`):

```zsh
mamba activate ae598-3dv
mamba install rerun-sdk
```

This includes both a cross-platform viewer (which will open as a separate application) and a python SDK. Also see the [rerun documentation](https://www.rerun.io/docs).
